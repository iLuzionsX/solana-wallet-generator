## what it does

this tool comes in handy if you want to start a solana project and want a customized solana address.
it basically generates addresses and outputs you the credentials for accounts that have a matching name.
Usually, Solana addresses are cut between the first 4 and the last 4 digits.
This tool gives you the opportunity to get a cool address for your project!
Please do not use it extensively because you basically spam the Solana network with it.
